    excerpt: 'Missing enrollment windows, picking the wrong plan, and ignoring late-enrollment penalties are just a few of the costly errors retirees make every year.',
    body: `Missing enrollment windows, picking the wrong plan, and ignoring late-enrollment penalties are just a few of the costly errors retirees make every year.\n\n**1. Missing your Initial Enrollment Period**\nYou have a 7-month window around your 65th birthday to sign up for Medicare Part B. Miss it and you could pay a 10% penalty for every 12 months you were eligible but didn't enroll — for life.\n\n**2. Assuming employer coverage protects you**\nSmall-employer coverage (fewer than 20 employees) does not automatically qualify as creditable coverage. You must still enroll in Medicare on time.\n\n**3. Choosing a plan based only on premium**\nA $0-premium Medicare Advantage plan can still cost you thousands through copays, coinsurance, and network restrictions. Always compare out-of-pocket maximums.\n\n**4. Not shopping during Open Enrollment**\nOctober 15 – December 7 each year is your chance to change plans. Many people never review their coverage and end up overpaying.\n\n**5. Ignoring drug formulary changes**\nPart D plans can change which drugs they cover each year. Review your formulary every fall during Open Enrollment to make sure your prescriptions are still covered at the same tier.\n\nCall us at 816-248-1100 — we review your options at no cost to you.`,

    excerpt: "Both fill gaps in Original Medicare, but they work very differently. Here's how to think through the choice for your situation.",
    body: `Both Medicare Advantage and Medigap (Medicare Supplement) fill gaps in Original Medicare, but they work very differently. Here's how to think through the choice.\n\n**Medicare Advantage (Part C)**\nBundled coverage through a private insurer. Often includes dental, vision, and Part D drug coverage. Lower or $0 premiums, but you're working within a network and may face higher out-of-pocket costs when you need care.\n\n**Medigap (Medicare Supplement)**\nWraps around Original Medicare and covers most or all of your cost-sharing (copays, coinsurance, deductibles depending on the plan). Higher monthly premium, but much more predictable costs and no network restrictions.\n\n**The core question: predictability vs. flexibility**\nIf you see specialists frequently or travel often, Medigap's nationwide coverage and predictable costs often win. If you're generally healthy and want low premiums, Advantage can make sense — just know what you're giving up.\n\n**Underwriting matters**\nIn most states, if you want to switch from Advantage to Medigap later, you may have to pass medical underwriting. Getting it right the first time matters.\n\nWe help clients compare their specific options side by side — give us a call.`,

    excerpt: "The average nursing home costs over $90,000 a year. Most retirees have no plan for it. Here's what you need to know.",
    body: `The average nursing home in Missouri costs over $90,000 a year. Assisted living runs $50,000+. And Medicare barely covers any of it.\n\n**What Medicare does (and doesn't) cover**\nMedicare covers up to 100 days of skilled nursing facility care after a qualifying hospital stay — but only skilled care. Custodial care (help with bathing, dressing, eating) is not covered at all.\n\n**What Medicaid covers**\nMedicaid does cover long-term care, but only after you've spent down most of your assets. Planning ahead is essential if you want to protect what you've built.\n\n**Your planning options**\n- Traditional long-term care insurance\n- Hybrid life/LTC policies (death benefit + LTC rider)\n- Asset-based LTC strategies\n- Medicaid planning with proper legal and financial guidance\n\n**The right time to plan is now**\nLTC insurance is underwritten based on your health. The older you are when you apply, the more you'll pay — or the more likely you are to be declined. Most people should look at this between ages 55–65.\n\nDon't leave this to chance.

    title: 'How Annuities Fit Into a Retirement Income Plan',
    category: 'Retirement',
    date: 'March 2026',
    excerpt: "Annuities get a bad reputation — sometimes deserved, sometimes not. Here's an honest look at when they make sense.",
    body: `Annuities get a bad reputation — sometimes deserved, sometimes not. Let's cut through the noise.\n\n**What an annuity actually is**\nAt its core, an annuity is a contract with an insurance company: you give them a lump sum, they guarantee you income — either immediately or at some point in the future.\n\n**Types worth knowing**\n- **Fixed annuities**: Guaranteed interest rate, no market risk. Simple and predictable.\n- **Fixed-indexed annuities (FIAs)**: Returns tied to a market index (like the S&P 500) but with a floor of 0% — you can't lose principal to market losses.\n- **Income annuities**: Designed to produce a guaranteed paycheck for life, similar to a pension.\n\n**When they make sense**\nAnnuities are best suited for the portion of your retirement income you cannot afford to lose — your "sleep at night" money. They're not investment vehicles; they're insurance against outliving your money.\n\n**When to be skeptical**\nVariable annuities with high fees inside tax-deferred accounts (like IRAs) often don't make sense — you're paying for tax-deferral you already have. Always understand the fees, surrender periods, and exit options before you sign.\n\nWe only recommend products that genuinely fit your situation. Let's talk.`,
